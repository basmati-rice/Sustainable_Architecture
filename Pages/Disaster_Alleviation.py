- Computer-controlled weights on the roof to reduce movement
- Automated glass shutters to prevent falling glass

- Foundations sunken in bedrock to avoid unstable clay
- Rubber shock-absorbers to absorb earth tremors, fitted with piezometers to generate additional energy using seismic forces

Designed to float on the water's surface during floods, amphibious houses ensuring the safety of residents and minimizing damage to property. Equipped with buoyant foundations or floating platforms, these houses rise with the water level, reducing the risk of inundation and structural damage. Their adaptability to rising water levels makes them an effective and resilient approach in flood-prone regions, offering a sustainable and practical response to the increasing challenges posed by climate change and rising sea levels.""")

st.markdown("Integration with electromechanical transducers such as piezoelectric and electrostatic generators in superstructures i.e. earthquake and flood solutions into buildings but also into substructures such as the creation of composite materials with cement mortar, and structural health monitoring systems.  \n  \n Also ensuring the durability of superstructures becomes paramount as sustainability also implies longevity and resilience of structures without causing pollution or excess waste during disasters.  \n  \n Advancements in piezoelectric materials, featuring improved electromechanical properties, have led to the creation of diverse types such as single crystals, lead-free variants, high-temperature options, foams, and nanocomposites. Moreover, the concept of harnessing energy from various sources concurrently—utilizing hybrid generators combining piezoelectric, electromagnetic, triboelectric, and pyroelectric mechanisms—has been proposed in recent literature.
