## <span>üå¨Ô∏è **Key Factors for Efficient Cooling System Setup**</span>

- Shading of windows
- Urban geometry optimization to ensure proper air circulation
- Facade design for high-rise buildings to minimize direct sun exposure
- Conversion of city rooftops and facades into renewable energy production areas.

### <span>‚ùÑÔ∏è **Underground District Cooling System**</span>

A central plant cools water and distributes it to various structures (banks, residential towers, shopping malls, schools) to save up to 40% of electricity compared to traditional air conditioners.

### <span> ü™û **Electrochromic Glass**</span>

Employs nanotechnology by utilizing minor electrical signals to charge the windows, enabling a modification in the radiation properties they reflect. This process effectively aids in regulating the internal temperature of a building.

### <span> üåç **Examples of Innovative Cooling Systems in India**</span>

- **AAETI, Rajasthan:** Utilizes a 3-stage cooling system, including indirect and direct evaporative cooling.
- **NIIT University, Rajasthan, and Sabhakhand Building, Gujarat Vidhyapith:** Employ earth air tunnel systems for heat absorption.
- **IIT Gandhinagar, Gujarat, and IIIT Delhi:** Implement district cooling and passive downdraft cooling systems.
